    "## Using directional OCT to understand photoreceptor visibility in AMD\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigators using adaptive optics (AO) retinal imaging instruments have reported reduced visibility of the cone photoreceptors overlying drusen as compared to those in unaffected portions of the same retinae or those in healthy retinae. Two compatible hypotheses have been offered to explain this phenomenon. Some have suggested that disease-related deformation of the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) reduces its ability to act as a wave guide, thus reducing the cell's familiar reflectance pattern. Others have suggested that drusen disorient the photoreceptors away from the eye's pupil, thus reducing the amount of reflected light that can be detected outside the eye. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to assess the contributions of these two potential factors to reduced photoreceptor visibility, we employed a custom research-grade OCT optical coherence tomography (OCT) system, along with a directional experimental protocol to acquire OCT images at a variety of positions in the pupil.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is intended to illustrate the analytical approach that we employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Directional OCT (dOCT) was realized by translating the OCT imaging beam across the horizontal diameter of the pupil. As described below, our analytical approach did not require knowledge of the beam's position in the pupil, so we acquired images from one edge of the pupil to the other in increments of 0.64 mm. At each location, between 1200 and 1600 B-scans were acquired. These were aligned and averaged using a custom semi-rigid body algorithm. For each pupil location, approximately 50 B-scans were averaged to generate a single averaged image for each pupil location. In the resulting average images, a semi-automated method was used to segment the inner-outer segment (IS/OS) band. The cone outer segment (COST) band was not studied because a clear boundary between COST and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) was rarely observed above drusen, and contamination by light scattered from RPE was unavoidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in this repository consist of the averaged B-scans from each location in one subject, along with the trace through the IS/OS band."
